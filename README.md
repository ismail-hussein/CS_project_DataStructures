PROJECT WRITE UP:
1 )
The chaining collision method works better than open address collision. When inserting a data file into a data base with chaining collision resolution there are less collisions and less search operations than an open address collision method. This effect becomes more pronounced as file sizes increase to much larger sizes.
2 )
An alternate data structure to bst would be a linked list or a vector. Usually there are many repeat professors so a short linked list or vector would easily be able to be searched through to find a professor.
3)
The main thing I noticed that was not optimal was the usage of linked lists. I thought for the collision chaining resolution using a vector to store the chain of course nodes would be much easier than using a linked list. I also don't think it was totally necessary to have an entire profBST class. I think this could have been implemented in the hash collision resolutions classes.
